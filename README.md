## This is the lab readme for 201n15 lab-02
#Thanks Nicole for helping me with the while loops! 

Well. the lab doesn't explicitly say to fill this out, but I figure it's good to do. 

The fiveQuestions() function is the meat and potatoes of this lab. It takes the users input via prompts, then has them run through a series of questions. Some intuitive, some hopefully not. When it is done, it outputs the number of times the user selected a true value, a false value, or an invalid value.

Uhh. Think that's it?
